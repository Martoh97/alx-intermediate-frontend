# Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML refers to using HTML elements that clearly describe their meaning and purpose in a web page. Instead of relying only on generic tags like `<div>` or `<span>`, semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` give context to both the browser and developers.

## Why Semantic HTML Matters

- **Accessibility**: Screen readers and assistive technologies can better interpret the structure and content of the page.
- **SEO Benefits**: Search engines understand the hierarchy and importance of content, which can improve ranking.
- **Readability & Maintenance**: Semantic code is easier to read, understand, and maintain for developers.
- **Consistency**: Encourages a standardized way to structure web pages.

## Examples

- Use `<header>` for the top section of a page instead of a plain `<div>`.
- Use `<nav>` to wrap navigation links.
- Use `<article>` for self-contained content like a blog post.
- Use `<footer>` for page or section footers.

## Conclusion

Semantic HTML is about writing code that communicates meaning, not just presentation. By adopting semantic tags, we create websites that are more accessible, search-friendly, and easier to maintain.
